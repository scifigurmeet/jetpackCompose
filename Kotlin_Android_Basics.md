# Kotlin Android Basics: Your First Activity

## Introduction

Welcome to Android development! This guide will help you understand the basic building blocks of Android apps using Kotlin. We'll walk through creating a simple activity step by step, explaining every piece of code.

## What You'll Learn

- What an Activity is
- How to set up a basic screen
- Understanding the Activity lifecycle
- How Android manages your app's state

---

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio installed
- A new Android project created (Empty Activity template)

---

## Understanding the Basics

### What is an Activity?

An **Activity** is a single screen in your app. Think of it as one page or window that users interact with. For example:
- A login screen is one Activity
- A list of items is another Activity
- A settings page is yet another Activity

### What is ComponentActivity?

`ComponentActivity` is a special type of Activity that provides modern Android features. When you write `class SampleLayout : ComponentActivity()`, you're saying "I'm creating a new screen that has all the modern Android capabilities."

---

## Let's Write Our First Activity - Step by Step

### Step 1: Create the Class

Open your `MainActivity.kt` file and start with this:

```kotlin
class SampleLayout : ComponentActivity() {

}
```

**What this means:**
- `class` = We're creating a new blueprint for a screen
- `SampleLayout` = The name of our screen (you can name it anything)
- `: ComponentActivity()` = Our screen inherits all the powers of ComponentActivity
- `{ }` = Everything inside these braces is what our screen will do

---

### Step 2: Override onCreate Method

Now let's add the `onCreate` method:

```kotlin
class SampleLayout : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        
    }
}
```

**Breaking it down:**
- `override` = We're customizing a method that already exists
- `fun` = We're creating a function (a block of code that does something)
- `onCreate` = This special function runs when your Activity is created
- `savedInstanceState: Bundle?` = A parameter that can restore your Activity's previous state (the `?` means it might be null/empty)

**Think of it this way:** `onCreate` is like the "setup" moment when your screen first appears. It's where you prepare everything before showing it to the user.

---

### Step 3: Call super.onCreate

Add this line inside onCreate:

```kotlin
class SampleLayout : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        
    }
}
```

**What is `super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)`?**
- `super` = Refers to the parent class (ComponentActivity)
- We're saying: "First, do all the standard Activity setup that ComponentActivity normally does"
- This is **mandatory** - your app will crash without it!

**Real-world analogy:** Before you customize your new phone, you need to let it boot up and do its initial setup first. That's what `super.onCreate()` does.

---

### Step 4: Enable Edge-to-Edge Display

Add this line:

```kotlin
class SampleLayout : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        enableEdgeToEdge()
        
    }
}
```

**What is `enableEdgeToEdge()`?**
- This makes your app use the full screen, including the area behind the status bar (where time/battery appear) and navigation bar
- It creates a modern, immersive look
- Without this, your app would have white/black bars at the top and bottom

---

### Step 5: Set the Content (Layout)

Finally, add `setContent`:

```kotlin
class SampleLayout : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        enableEdgeToEdge()
        setContent {
            
        }
    }
}
```

**What is `setContent { }`?**
- This is where you define what appears on the screen
- The `{ }` braces will contain your UI code (using Jetpack Compose)
- Everything visual that users see goes inside these braces

**Note:** The curly braces `{ }` after `setContent` are special - they're called a "lambda" and allow you to write Compose code directly. You'll learn more about this in Jetpack Compose.

---

## The Complete Code

Here's your finished Activity:

```kotlin
class SampleLayout : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        enableEdgeToEdge()
        setContent {
            // Your Compose UI will go here
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Understanding the Flow

When a user opens this screen, here's what happens in order:

1. Android creates an instance of `SampleLayout`
2. Android calls `onCreate()` method
3. `super.onCreate()` does the standard Activity setup
4. `enableEdgeToEdge()` configures full-screen display
5. `setContent { }` defines what to show on screen
6. The screen is now visible to the user!

---

## Important Concepts to Remember

### The Question Mark (?)

When you see `Bundle?`, the `?` means this value might be `null` (empty/nothing). In Kotlin, this is how we handle values that might not exist.

### Why savedInstanceState?

Imagine you're using an app, rotate your phone, and the screen rotates. Android actually destroys and recreates your Activity! The `savedInstanceState` can save important data before destruction and restore it after recreation, so users don't lose their work.

### The Activity Lifecycle

Your Activity goes through different states:
- **Created** → `onCreate()` is called
- **Started** → Activity is visible but not interactive yet
- **Resumed** → Activity is visible and user can interact
- **Paused** → Another activity is in front
- **Stopped** → Activity is no longer visible
- **Destroyed** → Activity is removed from memory

For now, just remember that `onCreate()` is the beginning of this lifecycle.

---

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the basic Activity structure, you're ready to learn **Jetpack Compose**! Compose is the modern way to build Android UIs, and it uses that `setContent { }` block you just learned about.

In Compose, instead of XML layout files, you'll write your UI in Kotlin code using special functions called "Composables." It's much more intuitive and powerful!

---

## Quick Practice Exercise

Try this: Create your own Activity called `HelloActivity` following the same structure. Just replace `SampleLayout` with `HelloActivity` and type out each line yourself. This muscle memory will help solidify your understanding!

```kotlin
class HelloActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        enableEdgeToEdge()
        setContent {
            // Ready for Compose!
        }
    }
}
```

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting `super.onCreate()`** → Your app will crash
2. **Wrong import statements** → Make sure to import `androidx.activity.ComponentActivity`
3. **Typos in method names** → `onCreate` not `OnCreate` or `oncreate`
4. **Missing parentheses or braces** → Kotlin is picky about syntax
